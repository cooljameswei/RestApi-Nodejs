## Getting started


This is a basic API skeleton written in JavaScript ES6. Very useful to building a RESTful web APIs 


This project will run on **NodeJs** using **MongoDB** as database. I had tried to maintain the code structure easy as any beginner can also adopt the flow and start building an API. Project is open for suggestions, Bug reports and pull requests.

## How to run

### Running  API server locally

```bash

```

You will know server is running by checking the output of the command `npm run dev`

```bash
Connected to mongodb:YOUR_DB_CONNECTION_STRING
App is running ...

Press CTRL + C to stop the process.
```
**Note:**  `YOUR_DB_CONNECTION_STRING` will be your MongoDB connection string.


## Tests

### Running  Test Cases

```bash
npm test
```

You can set custom command for test at `package.json` file inside `scripts` property. You can also change timeout for each assertion with `--timeout` parameter of mocha command.

### Creating new tests

If you need to add more test cases to the project just create a new file in `/test/` and run the command.

You can set custom rules for eslint in `.eslintrc.json` file, Added at project root.
